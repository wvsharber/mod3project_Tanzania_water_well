# Predicting Water Well Pump Functionality in Tanzania

## Summary
Easy access to water is one of the most influential ways to increase quality of living in rural areas. In order to identify pumps that are a good candidate for updating, repairing, or installing, we create a model that predicts existing pump functionality in communities across Tanzania. Our predictive model, which implements a consensus method based on 4 individual classifiers, is able to predict pump functionality with 82% accuracy.
